Apache Spark Apps based on Learning Spache Spark Book 

TBC

The code here, is in general, refactoring of the examples introduced in “Learning Spark by Holden Karau, Andy Konwinski, Patrick Wendell, and Matei Zaharia (O’Reilly). Copyright 2015 Databricks, 978-1-449-35862-4.” that I took while I wanted to try the examples by myself. 

The exception is ProcessJson that even at its core has the snippet to parse a Json from the book, I used as a starting point to convert it in a "real" app with logging, testing, etc.
