Apache Spark Apps based on Learning Spache Spark Book 

The code here, is in general, refactoring of the examples introduced in <i>“Learning Spark by Holden Karau, Andy Konwinski, Patrick Wendell, and Matei Zaharia (O’Reilly). Copyright 2015 Databricks, 978-1-449-35862-4.”</i> that I took while I wanted to try the examples by myself. 

<strong>ProcessJson</strong> is, however, a much developed example. It contains the snippet to parse content from a json file as in the book but I developed it to a "real" app with logging, testing, etc.
